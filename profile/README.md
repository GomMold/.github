# GomMold

## Proposal

In South Korea and other humid regions, mold is a common household problem that can affect air quality and even impact health. Mold can appear anywhere, from bathrooms and bedrooms to kitchen walls. Traditional mold testing methods, which rely on visual inspection or slow microscopic analysis, are often time-consuming and inaccurate.

To address this issue, we introduce _GomMold_, an application that allows users to identify mold simply by uploading or taking photos with their own devices. _GomMold_ helps users detect potential mold growth in their homes and provides personalized analysis.

Imagine waking up and noticing light green spots on your wallpaper. Unsure whether it’s mold or just dust, you open _GomMold_, snap a photo, and within seconds, the app identifies the issue and gives advice through the chatbot.

_GomMold_ integrates AI-driven image analysis and interactive feedback to deliver accurate detection, and practical cleaning and prevention tips through the built-in chatbot. In the future, _GomMold_ could be integrated into smart home devices such as humidifiers or air purifiers for automated humidity control and mold prevention.
